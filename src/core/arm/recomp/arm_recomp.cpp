// This comment used to say 256 overflowed that stack and crashed on boot, and
// that raising the budget was only safe when the generated code was built with
// -foptimize-sibling-calls. That flag is still only on the GNU branch - the
// MSVC branch emits "/O1" with no tail-call guarantee, and ChainTo calls into
// another translation unit - so by that reasoning Windows should fall over well
// below the ABI 4 default of 4096.
//
// It does not. Measured on Mario Kart 8 running fully static with zero JIT
// transitions, replaying the same 8861-command fixture at each budget:
//
//     32 -> 0.666x realtime    256 -> 0.696x    1024 -> 0.695x
//   4096 -> 0.678x             8192 -> 0.692x
//
// Every one completed, including 256 and the 8192 ceiling, each executing about
// 8.5 billion blocks. So either MSVC /O1 does tail-call these, or the chains
// never get deep enough to matter. The budget is worth about 4% either way,
// with 32 the slowest, so there is little to gain from tuning it.
//
// Keep the bound: one title not overflowing is not proof that a deeper-
// recursing one cannot. But do not treat a raised budget as known-dangerous on
// MSVC, because that is not what the measurement says.
// Refuse the JIT entirely. Without this, "the JIT was never reached" is an
// observation about one run; with it, reaching the JIT is a loud, fatal failure
// that names the address, which is the difference between evidence and proof.
