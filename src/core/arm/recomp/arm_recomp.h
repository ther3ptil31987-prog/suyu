 * CPU in suyu - the HLE kernel, every service, the GPU - reaches the guest
 * only through this interface. Satisfying it means a recompiled game gets the
 * real HLE and GPU stack instead of the generated runtime's stub SVC handler,
 * which is what stops a recompiled commercial title from getting past its
 * first service call.
 *
 * Execution model: RunThread runs recompiled blocks back to back until the
 * generated code parks on an SVC (it writes the instruction's imm and the
 * resume PC into the context, then returns), at which point we hand control
 * back to the kernel with HaltReason::SupervisorCall exactly as the dynarmic
 * backend does. The kernel then reads arguments through GetSvcArguments,
 * dispatches the real service call, and writes results back through
 * SetSvcArguments before resuming us.
