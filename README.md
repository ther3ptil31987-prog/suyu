## About

suyu is a Nintendo Switch emulator and AArch64 native recompiler written in C++. It can run decrypted Switch titles using either:

- **High Level Emulation mode** — full hardware-level emulation via the suyu core (GPU, CPU, audio, services)
- **Recompiler mode** — ahead-of-time static recompilation of Switch AArch64 game code to native x86-64 executables, bundled with suyu's HLE backend

Based on [Eden](https://git.eden-emu.dev/eden-emu/eden), with suyu's own improvements to UI, recompiler, and platform support.

## Status

Current version: **v0.0.13**. See the [v0.0.13 release notes](docs/releases/v0.0.13.md)
for Vulkan pipeline libraries, portable exports, key and installed-content fixes,
automatic largest-L3 core placement, and Static/Hybrid and mod improvements.

Platforms: Windows and Linux both build and run. macOS (arm64) builds and runs:
games boot under Vulkan/MoltenVK with the bundled MoltenVK library, and MK8D
races at 59–60 fps on the JIT; see [macOS](#macos). A RetroArch (libretro) core
builds for Windows, Linux and macOS. Android: the APK and an opt-in ARM64
libretro core build, but have run only in a software emulator; real devices are
untested. iOS is in development. FreeBSD has builds as well.

Linux needs five things Windows does not, all handled by
[`scripts/build-suyu.sh`][bld] in the consuming project:

- CMake 3.31 (`CMakeModules/CPMUtil.cmake` requires it; Ubuntu 24.04 ships 3.28)
- fmt 10 or newer — distro fmt 9 lacks `format_string::get()`; older copies
  now select the pinned bundled release automatically
- Qt6 Charts, which Ubuntu packages separately
- system Boost
- skipping the `externals/ownfoil` submodule, whose own nested submodule no
  longer resolves; nothing in suyu's CMake references it

Building on Linux found two defects that MSVC had silently accepted: literal
carriage returns inside string literals, and a boost forwarding header that
resolved only where CPM had fetched boost.

There will be a ROADMAP.MD for suyu's plans as a project soon.

## Static recompilation

**File > Export Game** turns a game into its own package. On Windows, a **Build**
export is a program with your settings, optional shader cache and automatic
controller setup, and can be added to Steam directly. Linux and macOS exports are
Source only. An export contains no game files, keys or firmware: every time it starts
it reads your own game file and decrypts it with the keys installed in suyu, so it
does not run without them. Hybrid and static exports (Source included) contain code
translated from the game, which only runs that way. An export is a local package, not
an official suyu release; official suyu downloads contain no game material. See the
[Export Game guide](docs/user/GameExport.md).

Static and Hybrid execution are experimental and tested on MK8D. In its race, a
v0.0.11 static export runs at about 56 fps on Windows (with Clang installed) and
about 60 on macOS and Linux, against 60 for the JIT; see the
[v0.0.11 performance notes](docs/releases/v0.0.11.md#performance).

| Mode (in Export Game order) | Purpose |
|---|---|
| suyu Dynarmic JIT (Baseline) | Default. Dynamic compilation; the most compatible. |
| suyu Hybrid JIT + AOT | Static code with JIT fallback. Performance varies by game; compare it with the Dynarmic JIT export. |
| suyu static AOT (Experimental) | Ahead-of-time AArch64 code with suyu HLE; for a host with Dynarmic entirely absent, build with `-DSUYU_NO_JIT=ON`. |

Builds configured with `-DSUYU_NO_JIT=ON` leave Dynarmic out entirely; releases no longer ship separate no-JIT downloads. Selecting static export mode in an ordinary host is a separate fallback policy; it does not remove the dynamic compiler from that host. No-JIT hosts require compiled coverage and cannot run unsupported AArch32 or runtime-generated code.

**Re-export Static and Hybrid games for v0.0.13.** Generated images use ABI 6 by
default, with page-table memory access, guard-generation checks and floating-point
fast paths. Compatibility output can use ABI 5. Automatic title bundles validate
manifests, image hashes, ABI and instruction bytes. Hosted library launches use the
current bundle rather than stale detached launchers.

A strict-static MK8D v4.0.0 TAS replay reaches a rendered, controllable race segment with zero JIT fallbacks. Full-race validation remains open. Tested paths are evidence of compatibility, not a guarantee for all titles or instructions.

Recording and playback are armed at boot. Use separate functional fixtures when loading times differ, record screenshots at milestones, and retain a bounded idle observation after EOF. Keep exact EOF and later milestone verdicts separate. Compare performance only with identical work, interleaved arms and an idle machine.

Older speedup numbers used a retired title-screen input fixture and predate the current guarded emitter. They do not describe current gameplay performance; the race figures above do (MK8D v4.0.0, measured 2026-09-22, full table in the release notes).

See [current release notes](docs/releases/v0.0.13.md) and the [campaign and regression safeguards](docs/static-campaign.md). Build/test scripts and synthetic instruction suites are maintained in [mk8-recomp](https://github.com/dougchansan/mk8-recomp).

## Changes in recent updates

Five of these are defects in suyu itself rather than recompiler work, and affect
ordinary emulation. Each is one commit.

### Fixes

- **Installed updates and DLC in NAND were never indexed.** `GetFileAtID` tried
  eight storage-layout variants but skipped every odd index except 7, so the
  `.cnmt.nca` suffix was only ever looked for at the cache root — never inside a
  `000000XX/` directory, which is exactly where meta NCAs are stored and what
  `InstallEntry` writes. Every meta NCA in NAND was therefore unreachable and no
  installed update or DLC ever entered the cache, silently: a miss is
  indistinguishable from nothing being installed, which is why the frontend's
  installed-title listing reported zero. A second defect behind it let an older
  update overwrite a newer one, because the metadata map is keyed by title id
  with no version comparison — now the higher `GetTitleVersion()` wins.

- **Service handler registration dropped most commands.** A
  `FunctionInfoTyped<T>` array was walked through a `FunctionInfoBase*` with a
  different member layout. `sizeof()` agrees, so a size assertion passes and
  tells you nothing, but every element after the first was read from the wrong
  offset. `IpcController` registered 2 of its 6 handlers;
  `QueryPointerBufferSize` was among the lost, and it is part of CMIF session
  setup — so titles stalled in early service initialisation.

- **RomFS registration was silently dropped.** `emplace` where
  `insert_or_assign` was meant, so re-registration kept the stale entry and the
  title panicked on boot.

- **AOT image dispatch resolved every PC to the wrong module.** Double base
  subtraction made every lookup underflow, and a four-entry module table
  mismapped any title with more than one subsdk.

- **The AOT exporter read the base ExeFS, not the update's.** `PatchManager`
  replaces the ExeFS wholesale when an update is present, so the exported image
  diverged from live execution on any updated title.

### Additions

- **AArch64 → C recompiler work.** Exclusives now route through
  `Core::ExclusiveMonitor` (previously a plain load/store with `STXR` always
  reporting success, which makes every compare-and-swap non-atomic under real
  threads); FPCR/FPSR are modelled; the counter and `CTR_EL0` are read from the
  emulator's own sources so the two engines cannot disagree across a transition.
  Plus EXTR/ROR, ADC/SBC, LDPSW, exclusive pair forms, PRFM, and the DC
  cache-maintenance family.

- **A build with no dynamic recompiler in it.** `-DSUYU_NO_JIT=ON` drops
  dynarmic from every target. The exclusive monitor, which every process builds
  regardless of engine and which dynarmic previously owned the only
  implementation of, now has a standalone one; `ArmRecomp` holds the
  `Core::ExclusiveMonitor` interface rather than dynarmic's implementation of
  it. See [Static recompilation](#static-recompilation).

- **Static and runtime coverage instrumentation** — per-module JSON of
  emitted/unhandled counts, and runtime histograms of blocks executed,
  transitions by cause, unimplemented opcodes and SVCs.

- **`suyu-cmd --probe-isa-list`** reports each title's CPU architecture without
  booting it, reading the update's NPDM as well as the base's. An update can
  change the answer: a title can ship a 32-bit base and a later 64-bit update.

- **Diagnostics** — the NPDM log line carries a content hash, because size is not
  an identity - two updates of one title can share a `main.npdm` size while
  differing in architecture - and `PatchExeFS` names which provider slot
  answered for an update.

## Legal Notice

suyu is a GPLv3 program, which allows fully free redistribution of its source code and releases liability of its authors for how this software is used as stated in Section 15 and 16.

The suyu Emulator program does not circumvent Nintendo's technological protection measures (TPMs) as the user is required to provide both the Nintendo Switch software & the encryption keys for these games, and the suyu Emulator uses a mode of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), an open encryption standard established by the US NIST, along with the encryption keys that the user themselves must lawfully acquire, to decrypt the software. As the standard is public and available to use by all, it does not constitute as the Digital Market Copyright Act's (DMCA) definition of "circumventing a technological measure" as defined in Section 1201(a)(3).

The suyu Emulator also falls under the exemptions stated in Section 1201(f) of the DMCA as this software was created for the purposes of reverse engineering the Nintendo Switch software (known as Horizon OS) to create interoperability with Nintendo Switch games and software with the Windows, macOS, and GNU/Linux operating systems.

Any aggressive DMCA claims or takedown notices against projects that explicitly disclaim piracy support, require user-provided keys, and limit functionality to interoperability (such as suyu) could constitute overreach or misuse of the DMCA.

As derived from §512(f), if Nintendo (or an affiliated entity) knowingly materially misrepresents that a project like suyu is infringing (or circumvents TPMs) when it does not, especially if they fail to consider fair use, interoperability exemptions under §1201(f), or the fact that the emulator requires user-provided keys and does not itself contain proprietary Nintendo code, they can be made liable for any Damages against suyu.

See [Legal.MD](https://github.com/suyu-emu/LEGAL.MD).

## Building

All three platforms below are verified: the Linux instructions were run end to
end in a clean Ubuntu 24.04 container, the Windows ones from a fresh clone, and
the macOS ones from a clean checkout on an M4 Pro (AppleClang 21, macOS 26 SDK).
Nothing here fetches a game, keys or firmware. Those are yours to supply.

CMake **3.31 or newer** is required. `CMakeModules/CPMUtil.cmake` demands it and
Ubuntu 24.04 ships 3.28, so on most distributions it has to come from Kitware
rather than from the package manager.

### Linux

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y \
  build-essential git curl ca-certificates pkg-config ninja-build nasm autoconf \
  qt6-base-dev qt6-base-private-dev libqt6svg6-dev libqt6charts6-dev \
  qt6-multimedia-dev libqt6opengl6-dev glslang-tools \
  libboost-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-context-dev \
  libusb-1.0-0-dev libssl-dev \
  libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libavfilter-dev \
  libswscale-dev libswresample-dev \
  libzstd-dev liblz4-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev \
  libx11-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxfixes-dev \
  libxkbcommon-dev libxss-dev libxtst-dev \
  libwayland-dev libwayland-egl1 wayland-protocols libdecor-0-dev \
  libegl-dev libdrm-dev libgbm-dev libvulkan-dev
```

Three of those are easy to miss and each stops the build outright:
`glslang-tools` provides `glslangValidator`, which the host shader step looks up
by name; the X11 and Wayland headers are what SDL3 refuses to configure without;
and `libavfilter-dev` is required by `FindFFmpeg` even though the emulator only
decodes.

If the distribution's CMake is older than 3.31:

```sh
V=3.31.6
curl -fsSL -o /tmp/cmake.tar.gz "https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v${V}/cmake-${V}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz"
sudo mkdir -p /opt/cmake && sudo tar xzf /tmp/cmake.tar.gz -C /opt/cmake --strip-components=1
export PATH=/opt/cmake/bin:$PATH
```

Then:

```sh
git clone --recursive -b mk8-recomp https://github.com/dougchansan/suyu-v0.0.4 suyu
cd suyu
cmake -B build -GNinja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DENABLE_QT=ON -DYUZU_USE_BUNDLED_QT=OFF \
  -DYUZU_TESTS=OFF -DENABLE_WEB_SERVICE=OFF \
  -Dfmt_FORCE_BUNDLED=ON
cmake --build build --target suyu suyu-cmd
```

The package metadata requires fmt 10 or newer because `logging.h` uses
`format_string::get()`. A distribution shipping fmt 9 selects the pinned
bundled release automatically. The explicit flag above also works and keeps
the dependency choice fixed.

Binaries land in `build/bin`.

### Windows

Visual Studio 2022 with the **Desktop development with C++** workload, Qt 6.9.3
for MSVC 2022, and the Vulkan SDK, which supplies `glslangValidator`. Qt via
aqtinstall if you do not have it:

```
aqt install-qt windows desktop 6.9.3 win64_msvc2022_64 -m qtcharts qtmultimedia
```

From a **Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022**:

```bat
git clone --recursive -b mk8-recomp https://github.com/dougchansan/suyu-v0.0.4 suyu
cd suyu
cmake -B build -G Ninja ^
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ^
  -DENABLE_QT=ON -DYUZU_USE_BUNDLED_QT=OFF ^
  -DYUZU_TESTS=OFF -DENABLE_WEB_SERVICE=OFF ^
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:/Qt/6.9.3/msvc2022_64"
cmake --build build --target suyu suyu-cmd
```

Point `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` at wherever Qt actually is; forward slashes save a
quoting argument with CMake. glslang 16 renamed `glslangValidator` to `glslang`
and suyu's CMake still searches for the old name, so if configure stops with
*"Required program `glslangValidator` not found"*, add
`-DGLSLANGVALIDATOR="C:/path/to/glslang.exe"`.

`suyu.exe` needs the Qt runtime beside it to start — `windeployqt` on the built
executable copies it in.

### macOS

Apple Silicon (arm64), with the Xcode command line tools and Homebrew:

```sh
brew install cmake ninja pkgconf boost ffmpeg sdl3 libusb enet glslang nasm qt
```

Then the same configure as Linux, plus Homebrew's prefix so Qt, FFmpeg and SDL3
are found:

```sh
cmake -B build-macos -GNinja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DENABLE_QT=ON -DYUZU_USE_BUNDLED_QT=OFF \
  -DYUZU_TESTS=OFF -DENABLE_WEB_SERVICE=OFF \
  -Dfmt_FORCE_BUNDLED=ON \
  -DVulkanHeaders_FORCE_BUNDLED=ON \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$(brew --prefix)"
cmake --build build-macos --target suyu suyu-cmd
```

`-DVulkanHeaders_FORCE_BUNDLED=ON` is the macOS counterpart of Linux's
`fmt_FORCE_BUNDLED`. Homebrew's `vulkan-headers` is found while
`vulkan-utility-libraries` is not, and `AddDependentPackages` refuses that
mixture, so configure stops with *"Partial dependency installation detected"*
rather than pairing a system copy of one with a bundled copy of the other. On a
machine with neither installed the flag is not needed.

glslang 16 ships `glslang` with `glslangValidator` as a symlink to it, so the
host shader step still finds the program by the old name.

Binaries land in `build-macos/bin`: `suyu.app` and `suyu-cmd`.

MoltenVK comes from the bundled CPM package (`V380-Ori/Ryujinx.MoltenVK`,
`v1.4.1-ryujinx`), is copied into `suyu.app/Contents/Frameworks/`, and is the
copy that gets loaded: `Vulkan::OpenLibrary` tries the bundle's
`libvulkan.1.dylib` and `libMoltenVK.dylib` before anything on the loader's
search path. The app therefore does not need MoltenVK installed. Pass
`-DYUZU_USE_BUNDLED_MOLTENVK=OFF` to prefer an installed MoltenVK instead.

macOS does not have NCE support yet. `HAS_NCE` is enabled for Android and Linux
arm64 only, so the CPU runs on dynarmic's arm64 backend, whose Mach
exception handler builds and links here.

### Android

Removed for now. The Gradle build is inherited from upstream and nothing here
has verified it since the fork, so publishing instructions for it would be
guessing. It comes back when it has been built and run.
