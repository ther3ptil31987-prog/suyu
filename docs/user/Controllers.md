# User Handbook - Controllers

Most of the controls should work out of the box. If not, please use a joystick calibrator to ensure it's not an issue with your own controller, for example:

## Controllers in exported games

A game made with **File > Export Game** (Windows package) sets up controllers by
itself. You don't need to configure anything first.

- The first gamepad you connect becomes **Player 1**.
- More gamepads become Players 2–8, in the order they connect. Each one acts as a
  Pro Controller.
- Unplug a pad and that player disconnects. Plug it back in and it returns to the same
  player slot (Players 2–8; the next pad to connect always takes an empty Player 1).
- Player 1 is never left empty. If every pad is unplugged, the keyboard goes back to
  Player 1.
- Devices that aren't gamepads are ignored.
- Left and right Joy-Con halves combine into one player automatically.
- The Home button works on gamepads.

Press **F12** in the game for the controls panel:

- **Combine Joy-Cons into one player** / **Split Joy-Cons into two players** changes how
  Joy-Con halves are used.
- **Resolution Scale** sets the internal resolution. It's saved in the package and
  takes effect the next time the game starts.
- **Use keyboard** or **Rebind** sets controls by hand. Doing either turns automatic
  assignment off for that package. To turn it back on, set
  `auto_assign_controllers=true` under `[Controls]` in the package's
  `user\config\sdl2-config.ini`.

Limitations:

- Joy-Con handling (auto-assign, Combine/Split) is covered by automated tests but has not
  been tried with real Joy-Cons yet.
- Linux and macOS exports are Source only, so none of this applies to them yet.

Tested with two pads (PowerA and Xbox Series X) at 60 fps in a Dynarmic JIT export.

## Using external controllers on the Steamdeck

In desktop mode ignore your pro controller/xbox contoller external controller and use **Steam Virtual Gamepad 0 as Player 1**. If you have multiple external controllers set **Player 2 to Steam Virtual Gamepad 1**. Steam app must not be closed on desktop mode.

Here's the annoying part of it. When waking up the steam deck from sleep try not to touch any button on the Steamdeck and turn on your external controller. Then open the Eden.AppImage. If you're lucky you can get your external controller to be position 0 and also Steam Virtual Gamepad 0 in desktop mode. If not that is ok too unless you need to configure player 1 to have gyro. You might need to repeat this to get your external controller as Steam Virtual Gamepad 0 so you can config Player 1 having gyro. You might be able to config player 1 to have gyro with the Steamdeck itself. Or you can also config player 1, 2, 3, etc, to have gyro somehow. Make sure they are all using Virtual Gamepads though.

Turn off controller then go to gaming mode. Try not to touch any buttons on the physical Steamdeck. When in gaming mode turn on the external controller. If lucky it will be assigned as Steam Virtual Gamepad 0. If not just use steam Gamemode feature to rearrange controller positions order.

Basically the Steamdeck or the external controller is fighting for position 0 and it depends on what is touched first after waking from sleep.
