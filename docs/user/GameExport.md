# Exporting a Game

Use **File > Export Game...** to turn a game into its own package. On Windows the
package is a program you can double-click or launch from Steam, without opening suyu's
window. Each time it starts it reads **your own game file**, which suyu decrypts with
**the keys you installed** from your own Switch - exactly as when you play the game in
suyu. Without that file and those keys an export does not run.

> **An export is a local package, not a suyu release, and not a copy of the game.**
> Official suyu downloads contain no games, keys or firmware. An export contains no game
> files, keys or firmware either: it records where your game file is. Hybrid and static
> exports do contain code translated from the game (the **Source** format as C), which
> only runs inside suyu together with your game file and keys; there is no standalone
> program. The exporter does not check who owns the game, and nothing about how an
> export is made shows that it may be shared. Do not upload exports, or logs and dumps
> made with them, to suyu's release or support channels.

> **Re-export static and Hybrid packages for v0.0.12.** The code-guard fix is compiled
> into each game's generated code. Updating suyu alone does not change an existing
> game executable. Packages made with v0.0.10 or earlier still need regeneration
> because their older code format is unsupported.

## Quick steps (Windows)

1. Open **File > Export Game...** and choose the game with **From Library**.
2. Check the **Update** row. Use **Install Update File...** if the update you want is
   not installed.
3. Leave **CPU Backend** on **suyu Dynarmic JIT (Baseline)** and **Export Format** on
   **Build**.
4. Optional: tick **Include transferable shader cache** if you have played the game in
   suyu. Saves, shader cache and per-game settings are off unless you tick them.
5. Optional: tick **Add to Steam library when the export finishes**.
6. Click export and wait for the progress bar to finish.
7. Open the package folder and run the game's `.exe` (or `launch.bat`).

## Choose the target and backend

The dialog can make Windows, Linux and macOS packages. Only a Windows export can
produce a ready-to-run program. Linux and macOS exports are **Source** only: they
contain generated code to compile yourself and no bundled runtime.

The CPU backends, in the order the dialog lists them:

- **suyu Dynarmic JIT (Baseline)** is the default. It is the normal emulator packaged on
  its own, and the most compatible choice. Windows only.
- **suyu Hybrid JIT + AOT** runs pre-compiled game code first and falls back to the
  Dynarmic JIT for anything it doesn't cover. Performance varies by game; compare it
  with the Dynarmic JIT export.
- **suyu static AOT (Experimental)** runs pre-compiled code only, with no JIT fallback. It
  stops when it reaches code it doesn't cover. Use it for testing.

Static and Hybrid exports are now much faster. For Mario Kart 8 Deluxe v4.0.0, a race
runs at about 60 fps on the Dynarmic JIT export and about 56 fps on Windows for a
static export (about 60 on macOS and Linux). A Hybrid export with Clang reached about
51 fps on Windows; Hybrid performance still varies by game. On Windows, reaching that speed needs Clang/LLVM
installed (see **Select an export format** below); without it, static and Hybrid
exports still work but run slower. **Re-export a game you already exported to get the
speed-up.** Static is still tested on Mario Kart 8 Deluxe only; the Dynarmic JIT stays
the default and the most compatible choice for other games.

The dialog also shows a coverage line for the selected game, for example whether static
AOT looks safe to try, or how much code still needs Hybrid's JIT fallback. Playing a
Hybrid export records any code that still needed the JIT, so re-exporting the same game
later can cover more of it. **Import / Export coverage file** lets players share this
information. A shared coverage file is execution metadata: the game's title ID, module
build IDs, code offsets and counts, and how many unsupported instructions were seen. No
raw instruction bytes, module names, file paths or free text are included, and suyu
refuses a file with any other field. Older coverage files can still be imported; the
instruction encodings in them are dropped. The coverage line says "at least" for
unsupported instructions once imported files are merged, because shared files carry the
count but not the instructions themselves. Hybrid remains the choice when static won't
run a game.

## Select an export format

- **Build** is the default on Windows. It produces a program that starts your game
  file with your keys; it does not contain the game. The Hybrid
  and static backends compile the generated code, which needs CMake and a C compiler
  and can take a long time for large games.

  The Windows download now includes an **export-build-kit** folder. Keep it beside
  `suyu.exe`; it supplies the matched host objects and libraries needed to link a
  game, without a suyu source checkout. Install the x64 Visual Studio C++ Build Tools
  with a Windows SDK and CMake/Ninja. LLVM/Clang is optional. The kit uses the default
  AOT features; disabling them through environment overrides requires a configured
  source build.

  Hybrid can leave a module to JIT if it fails to compile or exceeds Windows binary
  size limits. The completion result and package manifest identify those modules.
  Generated source files for a failed module do not cause it to be linked again.
  Strict AOT stops on these failures instead of silently switching to JIT.

  On Windows, the game code runs faster when LLVM/Clang is installed, because the
  export then compiles it with clang-cl instead of Microsoft's compiler (it also
  compiles faster). To get it, run `winget install LLVM.LLVM`, or add **C++ Clang
  tools for Windows** in the Visual Studio Installer. The export uses Microsoft's
  compiler when Clang is missing or does not work, and the export log and the
  package's `README_NATIVE_EXPORT.txt` say which compiler it used. To choose a
  particular `clang-cl.exe`, set `SUYU_CLANG_CL` to its path; to use Microsoft's
  compiler anyway, set `SUYU_RECOMP_COMPILER=msvc`.
- **Source (developers)** writes the generated C project, its `CMakeLists.txt` and a
  build script, and stops there. It does not include a compiled program, so the result
  is not playable; it is for compiling elsewhere or inspecting the generated code. This
  is the only format for Linux and macOS. The generated C is translated from the game's
  code, so a Source export is game-derived, but it carries none of the game's own files
  (no modules, data segments, ExeFS or RomFS). It builds only libraries that suyu loads
  alongside your game file; there is no standalone program to build from it.

While exporting, the progress bar follows the real work. The status line shows what
is happening, for example "Compiling 312/940 files (main)". During some setup steps
the bar pauses while the status line keeps updating.

The **Full code scan** option is hidden; it would not change the generated code.
For Hybrid, **Allow Dynarmic fallback if a module fails to recompile** lets the
export continue on the JIT for that module. Clear it to stop the export instead.

## Game updates

The **Update** row shows which update the export will use:

| Message | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Update X is available and turned on | The export uses that update. |
| Update included in this game file | The game file carries its own update, and the export uses it. |
| Updates are turned off for this game | Turn them on in the game's **Properties > Add-Ons**. |
| The installed update cannot be read | Reinstall it, or check your keys. Otherwise the export uses the base game. |
| No update installed | The export uses the base game version. |

When an update is used, a **From:** line shows where it comes from.

**Install Update File...** installs an update `.nsp` into suyu. It first checks the
file really is an update for the selected game. There is no Cancel while it installs.

If no update is installed when you export, suyu asks whether to install one or
**Export Without Update**. If the game file includes an update but updates are turned
off for that game, the export stops before it starts; turn updates on and try again.

An extracted ExeFS/RomFS folder carries no version information. Set the application
version overrides in suyu's configuration before exporting one, and check the version
on the game's title screen.

## Output folder

The default output folder is:

- `exports` inside the source folder, when suyu runs from a source checkout. Git
  ignores this folder.
- Your **Downloads** folder otherwise.

Keep the path short. Very long output paths can break the build; the dialog warns you.

Each export is built in a hidden `.suyu-export-<id>` folder beside the package and
only becomes the package once it is complete and has passed a content check. If the
export fails or stops, that folder is removed and nothing else is touched. An export is
never merged into an existing folder. If a folder with the package's name already
exists, suyu asks first:

- **Save as New Folder** writes the new export to `<name> (2)` and leaves the old one.
- **Replace (Keep Old as Backup)**, offered only for an earlier export, renames the old
  folder to `<name>.previous-<date>` - saves played from it included - and puts the new
  export in its place. The backup is never deleted for you.

## What goes into the package

**Always:**

- `user/config/game-source.ini`: where your game file (or extracted folder) is. The
  program reads the game from there every time it starts. If you move the game file,
  export again.
- On Windows, the program: for the Dynarmic JIT a copy of suyu's command-line
  frontend, for Build exports of Hybrid and static the code translated from the game,
  linked with suyu's backend. Source exports keep the generated C project in
  `aot_cache/` instead.
- A copy of your suyu settings, taken from one fixed list: graphics, CPU, audio,
  system and applet settings. Debug and unsafe settings, folder paths, input and output
  devices, the console name, the selected user, web service credentials and everything
  else stay behind.
- `LICENSES/`: suyu's license, notices for the runtime libraries, and `SOURCE.txt`
  naming the suyu revision the program was built from and where its source is
  published. The game material is not suyu's and is not covered by those licenses.
- `export-package.json`, which records what the package holds (title ID, backend,
  format, which optional data was included) and that it needs your game file and keys.

**Optional** (needs a game whose title ID suyu can read, such as one chosen **From
Library** or an extracted folder with a `main.npdm`), off unless ticked:

- **Include save data for this game**: only this game's save folders.
- **Include transferable shader cache**. Shaders your GPU has already built are
  reused, so the game stutters less the first time you play. On the Mario Kart 8
  Deluxe JIT package this removed a 5-second freeze at race start. A shader cache is
  built from the game's shaders, so it stays with this local package.
- **Include custom game configuration**. The game's own settings from suyu are added
  on top of your global settings, taken from the same fixed list. The settings file
  itself is not copied.

What was not ticked is not in the package, even when an earlier export had it.

**Never:** game files (ExeFS, RomFS, NSP, XCI or NCA), keys or firmware. See the next
section.

### Exporting from an extracted folder

An export from an extracted folder reads that folder each time it starts, so keep it
where it is. It may hold only what a game's ExeFS holds: the modules `rtld`,
`main`, `sdk` and `subsdk0` to `subsdk9`, `main.npdm`, `romfs.bin` (or `romfs`),
`control.nca`, `control.nacp` and `icon_<Language>.dat`. Each is checked for its
format. Anything else - notes, key files, firmware, shortcuts or links - stops the export
and names the file; move it out and export again. Subfolders and `desktop.ini`,
`Thumbs.db` and `.DS_Store` are ignored. A `main.npdm` belonging to another title is
refused.

## Keys and firmware

Exported games read keys and firmware from the suyu installed on the same computer:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\suyu\keys` and `%APPDATA%\suyu\nand`.
- A portable suyu: its `user\` folder.
- A custom NAND folder set in suyu is honoured.

suyu never copies keys or firmware into a package, never generates them and never
downloads them; it only reads the key files you install. A location that would lead
back into the package itself is ignored, and an export refuses to start if firmware has
been placed in its own `user\nand` folder: firmware comes only from the installed suyu.
Updates are read from those installed in suyu (**Install Update File...**) or from the
game file itself; an export that would need an update from anywhere else asks you to
install it first.

What is needed when:

| | At export time | When the exported game runs |
|---|---|---|
| Game file | Yes, to read and translate it | Yes, every time; the package has no game data |
| Keys | Yes, for encrypted game files | Yes, from the installed suyu, to decrypt the game file |
| Firmware | No (suyu warns if none is installed) | From the installed suyu; some screens need it |

Keys that decrypt a game, and hashes or checks that match a game's content, do not show
who owns the game or that it may be shared.

A portable suyu - `suyu.exe` with a `user\` folder you have added keys and firmware to -
is your own installation. Leave that data in place; a populated portable folder is not
an official suyu download and should not be shared as one.

Before exporting, suyu warns if no firmware is installed.

When an exported Windows game starts, it checks for them:

- **Missing keys:** a dialog shows the exact keys folder. Choose **Install keys in
  suyu** (shown when the suyu that made the export is found), **Open folder** or
  **Quit**. Copying `prod.keys` into that folder works just as well.
- **Missing firmware:** a warning with the firmware folder. You can install firmware
  in suyu, open the folder, or choose **Continue anyway**. Mii screens and some menus
  may fail without firmware.

## Run the result

For a Windows Build export, open the package folder and run the game's `.exe`, or
`launch.bat`. The package keeps its own `user` folder for settings, saves and logs.

The title bar shows FPS, frame time, the CPU backend, and "Building N shaders"
while shaders are being built. A stutter at the same moment as a shader build means
the shader cache didn't have that shader yet.

Each launch, an exported game first prepares the shaders in its cache: you'll see a
progress bar ("Preparing shaders: N of M") and "Building shaders N/M" in the title
bar. This is normal and usually takes a few seconds (about 3 for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe).

The package reports the game's real update version. Packages made before v0.0.11
showed "Ver. 1.0.0"; re-export them.

Controllers are assigned automatically. Press **F12** for the controls panel, which now
also has a **Resolution Scale** choice — it's saved in the package and takes effect the
next time the game starts. See
[Controllers in exported games](./Controllers.md#controllers-in-exported-games).

## Steam

Tick **Add to Steam library when the export finishes** to add the export to Steam as a
non-Steam game. It needs a Windows export with a program: **Build**, or the Dynarmic
JIT backend.

- The shortcut runs the export's own program. It is named after the game and backend:
  `<Game> (suyu Dynarmic JIT)`, `<Game> (suyu Hybrid JIT + AOT)` or
  `<Game> (suyu static AOT)`.
- **...and replace an existing shortcut for the same game** removes only suyu's own
  shortcut that launches this game.
- Artwork (cover, banner, hero, logo and icon) is made from the game's icon.
- **...and fetch cover art from Wikipedia** uses Wikipedia cover art instead. It sends
  the game's title to English Wikipedia.
- Your other Steam shortcuts are kept exactly as they were. If suyu can't fully read
  Steam's shortcut file, it leaves the file untouched.
- **Restart Steam** to see the new shortcut.

Steam shows no description for non-Steam games; that is a Steam limitation.

## Discord

Exported games show up in Discord as playing suyu, with the game's cover art (from
Wikipedia, which receives the game's title). This is on by default: to turn it off for
a specific export, untick **Show this game in Discord (cover art from Wikipedia)**
before exporting. To turn it off later, set `enabled=0` in the `discord.ini` file next
to the game's `.exe`.

## Known limitations

- Portable settings, the keys/firmware check and automatic controller assignment
  apply to Windows packages only.
- Steam shortcuts go to the first Steam account found on the computer.
- A game that isn't in your suyu library is named in Steam after its file name.
- Static exports on Windows can crash now and then when closing. A fix is included
  but not yet confirmed on Windows.
- Linux static exports start slowly.
- Static and Hybrid compatibility is per game. A successful launch only shows that
  the parts of the game you played work.
- Exports check that the game code and game data come from the same version, but this
  can't catch every mismatch. Test a package before relying on it.
- Standalone `.nca` exports stop when an installed update changes RomFS.
- A repeat export always builds from scratch; it no longer reuses generated code left
  in an earlier package.
