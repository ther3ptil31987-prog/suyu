# User Handbook - Configuring Steam ROM Manager

## Adding an exported game to Steam (no Steam ROM Manager needed)

On Windows, suyu can add an exported game to Steam by itself. Steam ROM Manager is
not required for this.

1. Open **File > Export Game...** and pick the game.
2. Use a Windows export with a program: **Build**, or the **suyu Dynarmic JIT (Baseline)**
   backend.
3. Tick **Add to Steam library when the export finishes**.
4. Optional: tick **...and replace an existing shortcut for the same game** to remove
   suyu's older shortcut for this game. Other shortcuts are not touched.
5. Optional: tick **...and fetch cover art from Wikipedia**. This sends the game's
   title to English Wikipedia. Without it, artwork is made from the game's icon.
6. Export, then **restart Steam**.

The shortcut runs the export's own program and is named after the game and backend:
`<Game> (suyu Dynarmic JIT)`, `<Game> (suyu Hybrid JIT + AOT)` or
`<Game> (suyu static AOT)`. Steam gets a cover, banner, hero, logo and icon.

Good to know:

- Your other Steam shortcuts are kept exactly as they were. If suyu can't fully read
  Steam's shortcut file, it leaves the file untouched.
- The shortcut goes to the first Steam account found on the computer.
- A game that isn't in your suyu library is named after its file name.
- Steam shows no description for non-Steam games; that is a Steam limitation.

See [Exporting a Game](./GameExport.md) for the full export guide.

#### Pre-Requisites

- Eden set up and configured
- Internet Connection
- Comfort Accessing and Navigating SteamOS Desktop Mode

### Steps

#### Initial Setup

1. Press the **STEAM** button and then go to *Power > Switch to Desktop* to enter the Desktop mode.

2. Install ***Steam ROM Manager*** (if needed), there are 2 ways you can accomplish this, either manually or through [*EmuDeck*](https://www.emudeck.com/#downloads).

    ---

    #### Manual Installation

    1. Open the *Discover Store* and search for *Steam ROM Manager.*
    2. Select the **Install** button to install the program.

    ---

    #### Installing Through *EmuDeck*

    <aside>

    ***NOTE***: This assumes you have already set up EmuDeck, if not - just run through the guided installation and select *Steam ROM Manager* as one of the options.

    </aside>

    1. Open **EmuDeck**, then navigate to *Manage Emulators.*
    2. Scroll down to the bottom of the page to the *Manage your Tools & Frontends* section. Click **Steam ROM Manager**.
    3. Click the **Install** button on the right hand side to install it.

    ---

#### Adding Eden into *Steam ROM Manager*

#### EmuDeck Users

EmuDeck will automatically create an *Emulators - Emulators* parser for ***Steam ROM Manager*** that uses shell scripts to launch them.  We will follow this convention.

1. In the file explorer go to your **EmuDeck installation folder > tools > launchers**
2. Right-Click some empty space and hit **Create New > Text File,** call this new file ***eden.sh*** instead of ***Text File.txt***
3. Right-Click the ***eden.sh*** file you created and hit ***Open with Kate***.
4. Paste the following code into the contents of the file, save and close the file.
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/sh -e
    emuName="eden" #parameterize me
    
    . "$HOME/.config/EmuDeck/backend/functions/all.sh"
    emulatorInit "$emuName"
    
    # find full path to emulator appimage
    appimage=$(find "$emusFolder" -iname "${emuName}*.AppImage" -print -quit 2>/dev/null)
    
    # make sure the appimage is executable
    	chmod +x "$appimage"
    	set -- "$appimage" "$@"
    
    echo "Launching ${emuName} with:" "$@"
    "$@"
    
    cloud_sync_uploadForced
    rm -rf "$savesPath/.gaming"
    ```
    
5. Open a terminal in the directory containing the ***eden.sh*** file and run the following command to make it executable.
    
    ```bash
    chmod u+x ./eden.sh
    ```
    
6. Proceed to the Adding the Emulator section

---

#### Non-EmuDeck Users

We will need to create a new parser for the Emulators.  Unlike with the EmuDeck model, we will have the parser look for AppImages.

<aside>

***TIP***: In order to ensure that the matches occur correctly, it is recommended that you name the Eden Appimage as ***eden.AppImage***, rather than what it downloads as.

</aside>

1. Open *Steam ROM Manager* and choose **Create Parser**.
    
    <aside>
        
    ***TIP***: You may need to go to **Settings > Theme** and set it to *Classic* to view this option.
    
    </aside>

2. Add the following settings to create the parser.
    
    1. Basic Configuration
        1. **Parser Type**: *Blob*
        2. **Parser Title**: *Emulators - Emulators*
        3. **Steam Directory**: *${steamdirglobal}*
        4. **User Accounts**: *Global*
        5. **ROMs Directory**: <path to directory containing eden AppImage>
        6. **Steam Collections**: *Emulation* (OPTIONAL)
    2. Parser Specific Configuration
        1. **Search Glob**: *${title}@(.AppImage|.APPIMAGE|.appimage)*
    3. Executable Configuration
        1. **Executable Modifier**: *"${exePath}"*
    4. Title Modification Configuration
        1. **Title Modifier**: *${fuzzyTitle}*
    
3. Hit the **Test** button to ensure your emulator AppImages. 
4. Hit **Save** to save the Parser.

---

#### Adding Eden to Steam

Now that we have the parser or shell script created, we can actually add it to Steam.

1. Open *Steam ROM Manager* if it is not already open.
2. Toggle the **Emulators - Emulators** parser on and hit ***Add Games*** in the top left.    
3. Click **Parse** to identify the emulators.
4. Make sure all your emulators are showing up and have the right matches.
    
    ---

    #### Correcting a Mismatch
    
    If the emulator is not identified correctly, you may need to tell *Steam ROM Manager* what the game is manually.
    
    1. Hover over the emulator card and click the magnifying glass icon.  Here it incorrectly identified *Eden* as a game by a similar name. **        
    2. Search for *Eden Emulator* on the *Search SteamGridDB* section and scroll through the results, selecting the one you want.        
    3. Ensure the *Name* and *Game ID*  update in the **Per-App Exceptions** and press **Save and close**.  The game should now update.

    ---
    
    #### Excluding Matches
    
    You may want to tell Steam ROM Manager to ignore some files that it finds in the directory.  This is how you do so.
    
    1. Hit the **Exclude Games** button in the bottom right.        
    2. Deselect the game you want to exclude, the poster artwork should go dim and the **Number Excluded** number should increment up.  Repeat with any other exclusions you want to add.        
    3. Hit **Save Excludes** when you are happy with your selections.
    
    ---

5. The program will now start writing the entries into the Steam Library.  You should get pop up notifications of the progress, but you can monitor the progress by selecting the **Log** on the left-hand side if needed. 
6. Restart Steam to have the changes take effect.  Check your library to ensure that your games are there, in a category if you defined one in the parser.    
7. Try to launch the Emulator from Steam and ensure everything is working.  You are now good to go.
